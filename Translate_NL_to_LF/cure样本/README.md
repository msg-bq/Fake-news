我们拿这个练个手，发现新的规则，就记录在[这里](https://github.com/msg-bq/Fake-news/blob/main/Translate_NL_to_LF/Pseudo_Specification.md)

第一次我们就以熟悉内容为主。师兄师姐你们各拿五个尝试一下，以此来评估下我是不是有没说清的地方。两点：1)涉及的规则有可能已经被总结进来了；2)有的样本可能会因为提取复杂，而本来就不打算总结规则。
不要求100%召回或精确率。所以表担心这个很难搞，是有基底的，并且太难做的我们本也不打算做。

涉及cure的样本如下(完成的在markdown格式下的括号内输入"X", 会显示为对勾)，师姐前五个，师兄6-10，剩下的我处理：
